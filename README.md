Fun little game where you shoot at moving targets

https://mjb825.github.io/Target-Practice/nocanvas.html

**Instructions**

Goal: score points according to target value (hitting an inactive target won't increase score)

Press `ENTER` to start game

Press `P` to pause game

Press `LEFT` and `RIGHT` arrow keys to adjust turret

Press `F` to fire at targets

Press `S` to view scores (if hosted on server that supports PHP)

Scores won't be retained using GitHub Pages because PHP isn't supported since it's only meant for static websites.
